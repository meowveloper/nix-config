# mcptoon — MCP tool-catalog compression

mcptoon is a zero-dependency CLI. If it is not installed yet, one command sets
it up: `pip install mcptoon` (301KB, installs in seconds, nothing else pulled
in). It gives you a compressed view of the user's MCP tools and calls them
back.

## When to use what

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| User asks "what tools do I have" / you need the tool catalog | `mcptoon manifest` (compact names only — ~2.2 tokens/tool) |
| You need one tool's real parameter schema before calling | `mcptoon inspect <server> <tool>` |
| Find a tool by capability | `mcptoon search <query>` |
| Call a tool | `mcptoon call <server> <tool> '{"arg":"value"}'` |
| You don't know which server owns the tool | `mcptoon call --auto <tool> '{...}'` |
| Huge JSON argument | `mcptoon call <server> <tool> --stdin` |
| Tool returns images/base64 that must never be compressed | `mcptoon policy set <server> <tool> raw` (one-time; applies to every later call) |
| Prove the token savings on this machine (tools + skills, one table) | `mcptoon bench` (`--roots DIR` for any catalog; `--json` for scripts) |
| One screen with every saving added up (tools + skills + cumulative) | `mcptoon report` |
| Diagnose connectivity/config | `mcptoon doctor` |

## Managing a skill catalog (mcptoon as the skill center)

Skills and MCP servers are the same shape — one source, many agent views — so
`mcptoon skills` manages both halves of a session's toolbox.

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| See what skills exist | `mcptoon skills list` (`--usage` adds per-skill hit counts) |
| Find the right skill for a task | `mcptoon skills resolve "<task>"` (offline, instant, no LLM) |
| Distribute one source to every agent's skill folder | `mcptoon skills sync [SRC] [VIEW ...]` (`--dry` to preview, `--copy` for real dirs) |
| Refuse "edited but forgot to bump the version" | `mcptoon skills sync --version-gate` |
| Regenerate the flat `.md` views (Roo / OpenCode) | `mcptoon skills sync --derived roo\|opencode\|all` |
| Create / retire a skill | `mcptoon skills add <name> --desc "…"` / `mcptoon skills remove <name>` |
| Retire a skill so a git sync cannot revive it | `mcptoon skills remove <name> --tombstone` |
| Park drift/removals in a chosen graveyard | add `--archive DIR` to `sync` or `remove` |

Sync views are **links** by default (a junction on Windows, no admin needed), so
one edit at the source is live everywhere and there is no second copy to drift.
Two safety rules hold: a real directory where a link belongs is **archived, never
deleted**, and a view that is *itself* a whole-directory link to the source is
left completely alone. `remove` **moves** the skill to a dated archive — a wrong
removal is a `mv` back, not a re-clone. `--usage` counts only skills mcptoon
routed; a skill an agent loaded directly is invisible there, and the output says
so rather than implying full coverage.

### When another manager already runs the catalog

mcptoon is designed to take over from an incumbent sync script **without a
cutover**, by matching it byte for byte first:

- `--version-gate` reads the **same** ledger the incumbent wrote
  (`skill_versions.json`; override with `MCPTOON_SKILLS_LEDGER`), so both reach
  the same verdict on the same bytes. A skill whose content moved while its
  frontmatter `version` did not is blocked with a printed reason; `--force` lets
  it through and rebaselines. An unversioned skill is warned about, not blocked.
- `--derived` output is byte-identical to the incumbent's, **including line
  endings** (a text-mode write turns the source's LF into CRLF on Windows), so a
  derived view does not become a diff the next sync has to fight.
- `--tombstone` commits a removal with a **path-scoped** `git add`. It will never
  run a whole-repo `git add -A`: a real skill repo has hundreds of unrelated edits
  in flight, and sweeping them into a "tombstone" commits another session's work.

Point mcptoon at sandbox views first with `MCPTOON_SKILLS_VIEWS` and run `--dry`
before any real sync. Do not run two managers against one view directory: during
a hand-over, one is the writer and the other is read-only.

## Tool exposure: the default, and how to switch back

When mcptoon is mounted as a gateway, it decides how much of the tool catalog it
hands the host. **The default is `compact` — the cheapest one — and it is
deliberate.** Know this before you tell a user something is broken:

| Preset | What `tools/list` returns | Cost per turn (12 servers / 96 tools) |
|---|---|---|
| **`compact`** (default) | mcptoon's own tools only — **8** | **~2,607 tokens** |
| `full` (fallback) | + every upstream tool's simplified schema (104 listed) | ~18,686 tokens |

**The upstream tools are not gone under `compact`** — they are withheld from the
*listing*, not from callability. `mcptoon_manifest` names them, `mcptoon_inspect`
shows one schema, and `mcptoon_call` runs it. The gateway's initialize
`instructions` say this too.

### If the user says their tools disappeared

1. Say plainly what happened: **the default preset withholds the tool list to save
   ~16,000 tokens per turn; the tools still work**, and you can reach any of them
   right now via `mcptoon_manifest` → `mcptoon_inspect` → `mcptoon_call`.
2. Prove it on the spot — do not argue from documentation. Run
   `mcptoon manifest` and show the user their real tool names.
3. Offer the second preset, and name the tradeoff honestly: it lists everything
   again (so a host's tool panel is populated, and a model that will not ask for
   the manifest sees the tools), at ~16,000 more tokens per turn.

```bash
mcptoon config set exposure full     # second preset; takes effect on next connection
mcptoon config set exposure compact  # back to the default
```

Do **not** edit the agent's MCP config to switch presets — it is one setting, in
one place, and `mcptoon off` still removes the gateway entirely. If the user's
host has an empty tool *panel* (a UI that reads `tools/list` to draw a picker),
that is the one case where `full` is the right answer rather than a preference.

## Install-time: takeover, and how to undo it

When `mcptoon quickstart` runs it finds the MCP servers already on the machine and
registers the gateway. By default it then **routes those servers through the
gateway** — it removes their direct entries from each agent config and reaches them
via mcptoon instead. This is the step that actually saves tokens: registering the
gateway *alongside* the direct entries saves ~nothing (the host keeps loading every
upstream schema). Measured on 12 servers / 96 tools: alongside ≈ 39,500 tokens per
turn, takeover ≈ 2,607.

**What takeover touches, and what it never touches.** It removes only servers
mcptoon manages — the ones in the user's mcptoon config. A server the user wrote by
hand that mcptoon does not know about is left exactly where it is. Before editing
any config file, mcptoon writes a `<config>.bak` holding the pre-mcptoon original.

**If the user asks "how do I put it back / undo this / get my old setup":**

```bash
mcptoon restore          # undo mcptoon's edits: drop the gateway, return your servers
mcptoon restore --dry    # preview which files would change
mcptoon off              # only removes the gateway entry; servers stay routed
```

`restore` is the true undo: it removes the gateway entry **and** puts back the
servers takeover dropped — the machine looks like it did before mcptoon. It is
surgical, not a file copy: anything the user added to a config after mcptoon's edit
is left exactly where it is. `off` is different: it removes only the gateway entry,
so the servers takeover dropped are **not** brought back. If a user says "I turned
it off and my servers didn't come back", that is expected — run `mcptoon restore`.

A host with an empty tool *panel* after install is the one case where `full`
exposure (above) is right rather than a preference.

## Result compression: on by default, and how to get the original back

Besides shrinking the *catalog* (the schemas), mcptoon shrinks the *results* a
tool returns. **It is on by default (`compress = smart`)** — a fresh install
compresses redundant results with nobody typing a flag. The footer's third line
reads `结果压缩（对话）— 已启用（自动）` when it is on.

**What it compresses, and what it never touches.** The safety gate keeps keys,
structure and scalars and only cuts payload from shapes that are repetitive:
lists of records, search results, directory trees, repeated log lines, many-key
objects. It **leaves alone** a single source file, one long prose answer, an
image/base64 blob, and any lone short value — those pass through byte-for-byte.
A compressed result is *reversible*: the full original is cached and the result
carries `full text: mcptoon_retrieve handle=<id>`; call the `mcptoon_retrieve`
tool with that handle to get it back exactly. Cache TTL is 300 s
(`MCPTOON_CCR_TTL` / `MCPTOON_CCR_DIR`).

**When a user says a result looks wrong, cut short, or "it lost my data":**

1. First, get the original back — that is the whole answer to "it lost my data":
   `mcptoon_retrieve handle=<id from the result>` returns the untouched payload.
   There is no data loss to repair; the original was never destroyed.
2. If the shape was one that should not have been compressed, pin that one tool
   to pass through: `mcptoon policy set <server> <tool> raw`.
3. If they want result compression off entirely: `mcptoon config set compress off`
   (back on: `mcptoon config set compress smart`).

```bash
mcptoon config set compress off      # no result compression at all
mcptoon config set compress smart    # the default
mcptoon policy set fs read_text_file raw   # keep one tool verbatim
```

**Be honest about the limit.** mcptoon cannot *detect* a bad compression: it
compresses before the model reads the result, so "did this hurt the answer?" is
not something it can observe. What it guarantees is the three layers above —
only safe shapes are compressed, the original is always retrievable, and one
setting turns it off. Do not promise the user automatic detection; offer the
retrieve handle and the off switch.

## Making mcptoon visible in a session

`mcptoon serve` returns an `instructions` field from the MCP initialize
handshake, so a connected client learns what mcptoon is without anyone editing
a system prompt, and can close a turn with one honest savings line. The figures
come from the `mcptoon_usage` tool, never from the model's estimate. Users who
find the line noisy turn it off once:

```bash
mcptoon config set footer off   # persists; the next connection omits it entirely
```

Note this is advisory — it works only when the client honours `instructions`,
and only when `mcptoon serve` is actually registered with that agent.

## Rules

1. **Prefer `mcptoon manifest` over reading raw MCP tool listings** — same
   information, ~99% fewer tokens on large catalogs (255 tools: 71,929 → 581).
2. `manifest` output is a **name index**, not schemas. Keep it in context;
   fetch the one schema you need with `inspect`, then call.
3. Tool names in `call` are `server_tool` (namespaced). `--auto` resolves
   the server for you when the name is unambiguous.
4. Never claim savings percentages you did not observe; if you quote numbers,
   use the ones printed by the command itself — `mcptoon bench` prints them for
   this machine. It needs `tiktoken` for the exact figures; without it the table
   is labelled an estimate, so do not report those as measured.
5. If a Claude Code plugin install wired the `mcptoon serve` bridge via
   `.mcp.json`, tool discovery is already compressed for the host agent; use
   the CLI commands above in terminal contexts or when the bridge is not
   connected.

## Setup

- Install/upgrade: `pip install --upgrade mcptoon` (zero-dependency wheel,
  301KB, installs in seconds). Confirm the upgrade before running it — pinning a
  version here would only go stale, but a bare `--upgrade` should be your call,
  not an automatic one.
- Source: this package is published to PyPI by GitHub Actions from
  `github.com/activeing123/mcptoon`. If an install prompt shows any other
  publisher or index, stop and check before continuing.
- Diagnose: `mcptoon doctor`.
- Undo: `pip uninstall mcptoon` removes the CLI. Its config lives in
  `~/.mcptoon/config.json` (plus an optional per-project `./.mcptoon.json`); remove
  those files, or drop a single server with `mcptoon remove <name>`. Nothing outside
  them is touched.
- Claude Code users get one-command setup instead:
  `/plugin marketplace add activeing123/mcptoon` (installs the CLI, wires the
  bridge, and bundles this skill).
