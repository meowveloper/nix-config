# Meow's OS

## My NixOS config

- hyprland
- Dank Material Shell
- Fully Declarative Flatpak management
- rmpc, yazi, lazygit and other TUIs
- > note that there is not a greeter, cause I do not want to use, so you gotta login from TTY and run Hyprland

## Usage
- change user-settings.nix as you like
- change hardware settings
- run nixos rebuild command
